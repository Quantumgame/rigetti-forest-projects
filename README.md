# rigetti-forest-projects
basic implementations of Rigetti Computing's Grove projects (formatted for python3)

the basic objective of this repository is to work through Rigetti Computing's Grove application demos,
and to further the work for implementations of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and quantum approximation
optimization (QAOA) algorithms.
